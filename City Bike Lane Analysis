# For this project, I downloaded City Bike Lane data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert City Bike Lane data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.CityBikeLanes (
id integer primary key,
year_installed year not null,
year_updated year not null,
street varchar not null,
width_feet integer not null,
safetyrating integer not null,
protected varchar not null)

#Then I inserted the city bike lane Data .csv into the table.
#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

# Find all streets that have bike lanes with a 4.0 safety rating or higher and label them as "safe lane".
with temptable as (
    select street, avg(safetyrating) as avg_safety
    from citybikelanes
    group by id
)
select street, avg_safety, 'Safe Lane' as tag
from temptable
where avg_safety>=4.0
group by street;

# list of all the bike lanes, both safety ratings for each lane, the average safety rating for each lane, and a label with the recommendation as "Remove", "Leave As-Is", or "Improvements Needed".
SELECT street, safetyrating,
AVG(safetyrating) OVER (PARTITION BY street) as "Average_safety_rating",
case when AVG(safetyrating) OVER (PARTITION BY street) >=4 then "Leave As-Is"
    when AVG(safetyrating) OVER (PARTITION BY street) >=2.5 then "Improvements Needed"
    else "Remove"
end as "Recommendations"
FROM CityBikeLanes;
